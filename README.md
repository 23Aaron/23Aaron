### About Me
i'm a python developer that loves to make iOS devices do stuff that they're not supposed to do

### Projects
- [Inferius](https://github.com/marijuanARM/Inferius/) - A tool for creating & restoring custom IPSWs onto an iOS device, similarly to xpwn.
- [homebrew-discord](https://github.com/marijuanARM/homebrew-discord/) A discord bot to fetch package information using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) API.

### Contributions
- I've ported multiple packages to [Procursus](https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus/), a modern iOS bootstrap with frequently updated UNIX tools.
- I help maintain [Sileo's Featured Page](https://github.com/Sileo/featuredpage), which is a curated page of tweaks & themes for all jailbroken iOS devices that use Sileo.
